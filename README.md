# stop-checking-in-secrets
A talk about better ways to be able to develop software and still keep the needed secrets secret!

This is part of my YouTube video series of __What every .NET Developer Should Know__ talks/videos.

Where I go over what I believe every .NET developer should have a working knowledge.

## Source code and example

All the source code and examples in the talk can be found at [My .NET Learning Repository](https://github.com/pulcher/dotnet-learning)
